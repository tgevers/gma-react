React and Google Maps JavaScript API Lazy Loading Demonstration
To demonstrate lazy loading of the Google Map Javascript API. Begin by clicking load.
The API is loaded a single time, when load is activated. All interaction, Parent to
Child does not trigger a reload, thus preventing unecessary consumption of the API.
